## üíº Work Methodology

In large-scale projects, I emphasize planning and collaboration before coding:
1. Submit a **UML-based design plan** for each task.  
2. Communicate dependencies and schedules with other teams before approval.  
3. Begin implementation only after design and timeline approval.  
4. Document work results for easy handover.

This approach reduces rework and ensures team-wide alignment.
